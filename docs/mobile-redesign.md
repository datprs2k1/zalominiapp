# Mobile Layout Redesign for Explore Page

The Explore page has been redesigned with a mobile-first approach to improve user experience across all device sizes.

## Key Changes

### 1. Responsive Layout

- Single column layout on mobile devices
- Two columns on tablets (640px+)
- Three columns on desktop (1024px+)

### 2. User Interface Improvements

- Added category filter with horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Implemented card-based news item design
- Added loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Included "Load More" pagination button
- Empty state for no results scenario

### 3. Component Structure

- Created dedicated `ExploreNewsItem` component for better control over styling
- Separated styles into a dedicated `mobile.css` file
- Improved accessibility with appropriate contrast and tap targets

### 4. Visual Enhancements

- Card-based layout with subtle hover/tap effects
- Excerpt preview for each article
- Improved image display with subtle zoom effect on hover
- Sticky category filter that stays visible while scrolling

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/pages/explore/index.tsx` - Main component with responsive layout
- `src/pages/explore/mobile.css` - Mobile-specific styles
- `src/pages/explore/NewsItem.tsx` - Dedicated news item component

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: Up to 639px (default)
- Tablet: 640px - 1023px (2-column grid)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (3-column grid)

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for images
- Loading states for better perceived performance
- Pagination to limit initial data load
- CSS optimizations for mobile devices

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future iterations:

1. Add real category filtering functionality (currently UI-only)
2. Implement infinite scroll as an alternative to "Load More"
3. Add search functionality within the explore page
4. Implement bookmark/save functionality for articles
5. Add sharing options for social media
