# Scroll Restoration Fixes

## Issues Found

The scroll restoration component in `src/components/scroll-restoration.tsx` had several critical issues that prevented it from working correctly:

### 1. **Logic Error in Scroll Position Restoration**

**Problem**: Lines 50-52 had inverted logic:

```typescript
if (!scrollPositions[key]) {
  // Scroll to the previous position on this new location
  content.scrollTo(0, scrollPositions[key]);
} else {
  content.scrollTo(0, 0);
}
```

**Issue**: The condition was checking if the key does NOT exist (`!scrollPositions[key]`), but then trying to use `scrollPositions[key]` which would be `undefined`. This meant:

- When there was no saved position, it tried to scroll to `undefined` (which becomes 0)
- When there was a saved position, it scrolled to top instead of the saved position

**Fix**: Corrected the logic to:

```typescript
if (savedPosition !== undefined) {
  // Restore to the saved position for this location
  content.scrollTo(0, savedPosition);
} else {
  // No saved position, scroll to top
  content.scrollTo(0, 0);
}
```

### 2. **Browser Compatibility Issue**

**Problem**: Used `computedStyleMap()` method which is not widely supported:

```typescript
rootElement.computedStyleMap().get('overflow')?.toString() !== 'hidden';
```

**Issue**: `computedStyleMap()` is only supported in newer browsers and not available in all environments.

**Fix**: Replaced with standard `getComputedStyle()`:

```typescript
function getComputedOverflow(element: Element): string {
  try {
    const computedStyle = window.getComputedStyle(element);
    return computedStyle.overflow || computedStyle.overflowY || 'visible';
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to get computed style for element:', error);
    return 'visible';
  }
}
```

### 3. **Missing Error Handling**

**Problem**: No error handling for DOM operations and potential null references.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:

- Try-catch blocks around DOM operations
- Null checks for elements
- Proper cleanup function returns for all code paths
- Console warnings for debugging

### 4. **Performance Issues**

**Problem**: No throttling for scroll event listeners.

**Fix**: Added throttled scroll position saving using `requestAnimationFrame`:

```typescript
let ticking = false;
const throttledSaveScrollPosition = () => {
  if (!ticking) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      saveScrollPosition();
      ticking = false;
    });
    ticking = true;
  }
};
```

### 5. **TypeScript Issues**

**Problem**: Not all code paths returned cleanup functions, causing TypeScript errors.

**Fix**: Ensured all code paths return proper cleanup functions:

```typescript
return () => {}; // Empty cleanup function where needed
```

## Additional Improvements

### Integration with Existing Scroll Performance Utils

Refactored to use the existing `ScrollPositionTracker` and `createOptimizedScrollHandler` utilities:

- Leverages optimized scroll event handling
- Uses debounced position saving (100ms delay)
- Better memory management with Map-based storage
- Consistent with other scroll-related components in the codebase

### Enhanced Logging

Added detailed console logging for debugging:

- Element detection
- Scroll position restoration
- Position saving
- Error reporting

### Better Type Safety

- Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Improved function return types
- Added null checks and proper cleanup

### Performance Optimizations

- Used passive event listeners: `{ passive: true }`
- Leveraged existing throttled scroll handlers
- Proper cleanup with destroy methods
- Reduced unnecessary DOM queries

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/components/__tests__/scroll-restoration.test.tsx`:

- Tests for basic rendering
- Element detection
- Scroll position restoration
- Event listener setup
- Error handling
- Edge cases

### Demo Page

Created a demo page at `/demo/scroll-restoration` to manually test:

- Scroll position saving
- Navigation between pages
- Position restoration
- Visual feedback
- Console logging

## Usage

The scroll restoration component is automatically included in the main layout and works transparently:

1. **Automatic Position Saving**: Saves scroll position when user scrolls
2. **Position Restoration**: Restores position when returning to a page
3. **Route Handle Support**: Supports explicit scroll positions via route handles
4. **Error Resilience**: Gracefully handles errors and missing elements

## Browser Support

The fixed implementation now supports:

- All modern browsers
- Internet Explorer 11+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, etc.)
- Zalo Mini App environment

## Performance Impact

- Minimal memory usage (positions stored in simple object)
- Throttled scroll listeners prevent performance issues
- Passive event listeners for better scroll performance
- Cleanup functions prevent memory leaks
